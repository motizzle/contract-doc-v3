    "[bot] Okay, let’s focus on the core challenge of catching up to this rapidly evolving technology.\n\nHere’s a concise response, acknowledging the significant speed of change and aiming for clarity:\n\n“We understand the urgency. Given the contract’s emphasis on independent contract document experience and the technology’s rapid evolution, we need a streamlined approach to ensure consistent and accurate document management.\n\nThe current context highlights a shift from traditional document handling – we’re moving away from formatting, redlining, and commenting. This necessitates a new strategy for managing these documents, likely involving automated workflows and potentially leveraging technologies that can adapt quickly.\n\nSpecifically, the 2026 goal of independent contract document experience is critical.  We need to proactively identify and implement solutions to bridge the gap between our current workflow and this requirement.\n\nThe core infrastructure includes invisible work – foundational elements that are essential for baseline functionality.  We’re focusing on ensuring these elements are robust and adaptable to future changes.\n\nTo address this, we’ll prioritize a phased approach: 1)  Rapid prototyping and testing of automated document management solutions. 2)  Establishing clear guidelines and standards for document lifecycle management. 3)  Continuous monitoring of technology advancements and incorporating them into our processes.  Let’s begin by outlining the immediate priorities to ensure we achieve this goal efficiently.”\n\n---\n\nEssentially, I’ve summarized the key takeaways – the need for agility, a focus on automation, and a prioritized approach to bridge the technological gap.",
