If you actually read this let me know. This might be a wasted feature lol

In this version we fixed sum bugs and made sum stuff.

Bugs:
- Version comparison didn't work if you were using v1
- Fixed broken automated tests so I don't have to click for evaaaa

Improvements:
- Better automated sideloading scripts (Windows should be solid and mac is...fingers crossed)
- Internal mode toggle via URL params (ask if you think you need it)
- Moaaaaarrrrr tests
